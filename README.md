This fixed wing simulator is build in MATLAB&Simulink with the skeleton code provided by [1]. The official template files is stored at https://github.com/randybeard/mavsim_template_files. When I build this repo only the MATLAB&Simulink files were provided and now seems like it supports Python as well. A quadrotor simulator is build upon the foundation of this simulator and stored in another repository https://github.com/stan-lu/Quadrotor-simulator.
